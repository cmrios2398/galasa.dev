Galasa is different from other test tools. It is a deep integration test framework, enabling you to test applications that interact with z/OS (including CICS applications) without stubbing or mocking. 

Galasa tests are not limited to testing mainframe-specific applications - they can extend to encompass entire families of hybrid cloud applications. Most manual tests can be automated with Galasa, helping you to deliver changes to your core applications quickly and successfully. 

Galasa is open-source, so thereâ€™s no vendor lock-in; it can be integrated into an existing pipeline and work with third-party tooling. 

Galasa is constructed with scalability in mind, to serve enterprise requirements and work across multiple technologies to enable reliable, repeatable automated testing.


## Use Galasa to help you to: 

-	deliver new functions to applications fast and with confidence to delight your users 
-	easily verify system functionality post maintenance
-	quickly validate your applications against new releases of middleware or operating system updates
-	simplify the construction of new integration tests and incorporate them easily into future regression test suites
